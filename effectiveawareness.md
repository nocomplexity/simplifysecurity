# Making awareness work

## Problem
Not all security problems within an organisation are suited for addressing in a security awareness program. Determining what problems are suited for a security awareness program or workshop can require too much time and research.

## Solution
Many service companies provide security awareness programs. But the truth is that 80% of the training and programs are and should be generic and only 20% must be tailored for a specific organisation context.

Most common topics for security awareness campaigns are:

| Topic                 | Messages                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Incident response     | - Recognise security incidents<br>- Report security breaches                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Common problems can and should be addressed by a security awareness program:


| Problem | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| Achieving a culture change | It is difficult to effect a cultural change or achieve a common value across the organisation where the culture does not value security. |
| Cultural and departmental variations | Differences across large, distributed organisations cause problems achieving consistency between departments and countries.  |
| Distributed security management | Organisations with a distributed or decentralised security function face difficulties in developing and managing awareness when the team is spread across divisions and countries. |
| Legal and regulatory issues | Organisations consider legal and privacy issues to be part of the security team’s responsibilities, and these have to be included within awareness programmes. National variations in legislation may require that campaigns are restructured for each country in which they are delivered. |
| Disregarding policy | Users choose to ignore policy and disregard security requirements. Management permits exceptions to security rules without considering the risk implications. |
| Lack of basic awareness | New members of staff often have little understanding of the organisation’s policies, culture or their security responsibilities. |
| Poor systems security | Complying with security development , like [SAMM](https://nocomplexity.com/documents/securityarchitecture/architecture/frameworks.html#frameworks) standards and hence ensure that security measures are built into applications. |
| Technical security issues | A key technical problem that requires an awareness fix is that of viruses, since users must be taught to not bypass controls or open ‘suspect’ files.  |
| Justifying security | In organisations that recognise the need for security, there is often little perception of information as an asset, and it is hard to justify security budgets or activities in such cases. |
| Resistance to security | Middle and senior management are still  seen as resisting security because of a lack of interest or failure to understand their own responsibilities. |

Define clear objectives. Some common objectives you can reuse are:


| Driving Force | Example actions to increase Driving Force |
| :---- | :---- |
| Need to reduce costs | * Show how poor security costs more time and money in the long term <br> * Demonstrate current costs, issues and alternatives for security <br> *  Show feasibility of cost savings |
| Achieve compliance with policy and regulations | - Ask Internal Audit Department to inform departments of security audit requirements well in advance of the audit <br/> - Threat of disciplinary action for breaches of policy <br/> - Link staff bonus to compliance with policies <br/> - Demonstrate consequences of e-mail and Internet abuse <br/> - Incorporate e-mail and Internet policies into induction training <br/> - Publish audit results league table (‘name and shame’) |
| Reduce number and severity of security incidents | - Configure systems to make anti-virus software mandatory <br> - Record time spent fixing virus related problems and user downtime <br/> -‘Virus-free’ awards for individual departments (with associated publicity across the organisation) <br> -Implement effective content management systems <br/> - Show cost savings on time spent dealing with incidents |
| Protect reputation | - Demonstrate threat to reputation and collect data on incidents affecting other organisations in the same sector |
| Management support for security | - Demonstrate that current vulnerabilities are ‘real’ <br/> -Deliver awareness programme to management first (pilot scheme) <br/> - Use [risk analysis tools](https://nocomplexity.com/documents/securitysolutions/generatedfiles/vulnerabilitymanagement.html#vulnerability-management-solutions)  with management to both gather information and raise awareness <br/> - Identify key management stakeholders for security <br/> - Obtain delegated CEO mandate for all security activities <br/> - Quantify costs of security incidents and assign back to business owners <br/> - Deliver annual risk statements to business management with clear assignment of responsibility and ownership for problems |
