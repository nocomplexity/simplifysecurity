# Preface

Automation has changed our lives. Computers and all kinds of software enabled devices make our daily lives easier. Every year computer devices get more powerful, less expensive but also get more vulnerable to cyber security risks. Too often cyber security breaches have a severe impact on our safety, privacy and our daily activities. 

Cyber security is a vital concern for individuals, organisations, and societies at large. To address this pressing issue and ensure a secure and safer digital environment, we need better solutions than we had. However better does not mean you should use the latest hyped holy grail security products. Often proven old simple solutions work better.

We know that cyber security protection can be much better and simpler. Established large commercial cyber security companies  will not change overnight. So we advocate for simple cyber security solutions, by showing and promoting that simple solutions that are affordable for everyone do exist.

Our aim is to simplify cyber security to accelerate its effectiveness.
