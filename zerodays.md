# Preventing Zero-Day Attacks

## Problem

Zero-day attacks are among the most challenging threats for any company, regardless of size. These attacks can have major consequences for both large enterprises and small businesses.

## Solution

Large and small companies worldwide often rely on various SaaS platforms, Microsoft 365 products, and other commercial software for their core business operations. From a security perspective, closed-source software isn't inherently worse than good open-source alternatives. The core of the problem often lies in not continuously and consistently applying [security by design](https://nocomplexity.com/documents/securitybydesign/intro.html) on a daily basis.

To prevent zero-day attacks, you should:

* Develop [threat models](https://nocomplexity.com/documents/securityarchitecture/architecture/threadmodels.html#threat-models) for all key processes.
* Implement a process for continuous risk analysis of key processes, utilizing available threat models.
* Maintain a [security architecture](architecture.md) that's continuously updated and based on solid security principles.
* Ensure that obvious security principles, such as [Zero Trust](https://nocomplexity.com/documents/securityarchitecture/architecture/NCSC-zerotrustprinciples.html#ncsc-zero-trust-principles), are followed and enforced.
* Practice and plan for disasters through robust Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) Planning. Have measures in place to ensure critical operations remain functional, helping to prevent bankruptcy.


In essence we know what to do. It is not rocket science. It is continuous boring work that must be done on a daily basis. Technology, Software and hardware, is and will be vulnerable for zero day attacks. 


There is not a single silver bullet. You must perform all the usual, boring, non-sexy, time-consuming and resource-intensive security tasks that have been proven to be effective for over 30 years. While technology changes, the fundamental solutions for real zero-day protection remain consistent.
