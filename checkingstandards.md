# Check Internet Standards

## Problem 

Testing a website on security or your email domain can be complex and time consuming.

## Solution 

Not many, but a few good online testing services exist. These services require no account, no cost but provide you directly with good information on possible security improvements possible.

:::{warning}  
Never ever use commercial online testing services! 

**Use only online tests from a trusted foundation that you can verify!**

Too often you will be hacked later. This is kind of a business model.  
So never trust an online service, but always verify and be very careful!
